    "### **MinION sequencing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of DNA sequencing is to obtain the specific disposition of the consecutive nucleotides (A, T, G and C “letters”) of an organism. The entire nucleotide sequence of an organism is what is known as the genome. Among many achievements, DNA sequencing have allowed the identification of the characteristic genes of species and the identification of the genetic basis of many diseases. Although at the moment DNA sequencing is restricted to research centers and hospitals, some suggest that it will be a central tool in everyday life of all of us in the near future. Technological advances in the last 10 years have led to the development of new generation sequencing methods (also known as Next Generation Sequencing or NGS) that provide a massive amount of sequencing data, as millions of independent sequencing processes of the test sample or organism take place simultaneously, very quickly and at low cost. Sequencing of the entire genome is therefore attained by cloning the DNA, to obtain tons of short sequences (known as reads) that are variable need to be assembled like the pieces of a puzzle. As in a puzzle, the shorter the pieces that are provided by the technology, the larger the number of those pieces that are needed to complete the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent NGS methods (also known as Next NGS or third generation NGS) allow to obtain longer reads directly on real time from a single DNA molecule without the need to clone. This has many advantages, most prominently that the puzzle can be assembled with less pieces, and that the time and resources needed to complete the process (from sample to results) is dramatically reduced. A company called Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) recently designed the smallest handheld sequencing device ever, called MinION. Because of this, MinION becomes portable, being limited just by the necessity to be plugged in to a computer to be able to work and analyze the resulting sequence. Sequencing is achieved by the use of biological nanopores that are inserted in a synthetic membrane (Figure 1). By their combination with other devices that are integrated on a circuit chip, the passage of each base of a single-stranded DNA sequence by the nanopore is translated into a signal that is characteristic for each base and its sequence of the environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "The characteristic electric signals, also called events, are recorded in a digital file with FAST5 format. For these to be understandable by us, the first step just after the sequencing is the translation of the electric signals generated into the nucleotide letters, a step known as basecalling. For this step NanoDJ uses a software called Albacore that runs from the command line with some important indications or arguments such as: the place (directory) where the FAST5 files are, the location where the output is to be delivered, the computer resources to be used (number of computing threads), and specific information of the reagents employed for preparing the sample. A typical line of arguments can be: \n"

The Guanine - Cytosine pair is bound in the double helix by three hydrogen bonds, which increases the stability of the DNA molecule. The GC content has an impact in the technology, as regions with higher or lower GC content are more difficult to sequence. Besides, the GC content is variable among the different organisms and regions of the genome. Due to the nature of the genetic code, it is practically impossible for an organism to have a genome with a GC content approaching 0% or 100%. Therefore, exploring the distribution of the GC content of the sequencing results can provide useful information, as it can help identifying possible artifacts in the data that must be discarded before moving forward in the analysis.\n",
