    "This notebook relies on [Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu) to get a draft genome assembly, and in Nanopolish to improve the consensus sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canu is a popular assembler based on the Celera Assembler that can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and almost complete eukaryotic chromosomes. Canu has three stages: correction, trimming and assembly. Each of the stages can be executed independently or in series. More information of the process is available in the 2.0_DeNovo_Canu-Miniasm.ipynb notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step is to get the draft assembly. Although this can be done with any assembly tool for ONT data, the following commands use Canu:"
