    "\n",
    "An initial analysis to evaluate the quality of the reads resulting from the experiment is highly recommended. For this, NanoDJ relies on the Python programming language and the [BioPython](biopython.org/) module to evaluate the quality of basecalls, and the number, length and GC content of the reads. Processing the data using Python and this module allows greater control when filtering or visualizing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Biopython package uses the SeqIO module, which provides an interface to input and output assorted sequence files (as FASTA/FASTQ). Sequences are sorted as SeqRecord objects, a data structure for sequences that can also store more information than the sequence itself and makes it easy to get some interesting metrics such as the Phred score. Other data science modules like numpy and pandas are used to process the data as a table and the module matplotlib to generate visualizations of the data.\n",

    "GC content is the percentage of guanine or cytosine bases that are present in the DNA. The Guanine - Cytosine pair is bound in the double helix by three hydrogen bonds, which increases the stability of the DNA molecule. The GC content of a sequence has usually an impact in the sequencing results, as regions with higher or lower GC content are more difficult to sequence. Besides, the GC content is variable among the different organisms and regions of the genome. Due to the nature of the genetic code, it is practically impossible for an organism to have a genome with a GC content approaching 0% or 100%. Therefore, exploring the distribution of the GC content of the sequencing results can provide useful information, such as to help identifying possible artefacts in the data that must be discarded before moving forward in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biopython's SeqIO built-in functions extracts the information from DNA sequences and builds a dataframe with the useful features. In this step, using matplotlib one can generate visualizations. The distribution of GC content will be plotted with the following lines of code. The percentage of GC will be presented in the x axis and the number of reads in the y axis."
