    "## Alignment with BWA, Rebaler and BLAST\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms to efficiently align short reads, although they are not optimal for long reads (e.g. ONT reads). To put it simple, long-reads are usually affected by structural variations and the indels that may be due to sequencing errors. For this reason, NanoDJ relies on aligners such as BWA, Rebaler or BLAST that are better for finding local matches. "

    "Burrows Wheeler Aligner ([BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa)) is carefully designed to achieve a good balance between performance and accuracy in the alignment. BWA is software package that includes tools for mapping ONT long reads to a reference, including many alternative alignment algorithms. Some of them are ideal for short-reads, while others are better suited for long reads. BWA-MEM is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and chimeras, and is applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70 bp to a few Mb. \n",

    "This algorithm is used many times in NanoDJ notebooks as a step for some of the applications. BWA needs the sequence reads and a reference as inputs and supports more than one execution thread with the **-t** option.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Rebaler](https://github.com/rrwick/Rebaler) is used to obtain reference-based assemblies but can also reassemble/polish an assembly of long reads, using a reference assembly to guide the large-scale structure. Another advantage of Rebaler is that the reference assembly sequence does not influence the sequence of the resulting assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the reference, Rebaler uses minimap2 to align long reads to the reference. Then, it Removes lower quality alignments (judged by length, identity and size of indels) until the reference is just covered. Any given position in the reference should now have a coverage of 1 or 2 (or 0 if the reads failed to cover a spot). The reference sequence is replaced with corresponding read fragments to produce an unpolished assembly. If parts of the reference had no read coverage, the original reference sequence will be left in place.\n",
