    "## Adapter trimming and barcode demultiplexing with Porechop\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ONT applications can gain advantage of pooling (multiplexing) different samples by using sequence adapters to reduce the costs of the sequencing run. As a consequence, the results of the run will be a mixture of reads with different adapters tagging each sample. NanoDJ relies on [Porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) for finding and trimming ONT adapters and demultiplexing the barcoded ONT reads. Porechop commands and options are shown in the command usage:"
