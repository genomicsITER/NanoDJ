NanoDJ is a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook integration of tools for simplified manipulation and assembly of DNA sequences produced by [ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/) devices. It integrates basecalling, read trimming and quality control, simulation and plotting routines with a variety of widely used aligners and assemblers, including procedures for hybrid assembly. 

![alt_text](https://github.com/genomicsITER/NanoDJ/blob/master/NanoDJ_pipeline_chart.png "NanoDJ-pipeline2")

NanoDJ is built as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container that runs a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instance. The user can work with ONT data using the notebooks that are provided or open a new Jupyter Lab session and run the included software packages.

This project is now integrated in [VICE](https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/getting_started/about.html), a visual and interactive computing environment which is part of [CyVerse](https://www.cyverse.org/), a project that consist of platforms, tools and services built in order to provide life scientists with powerful computational infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses. Full intructions of how to launch a NanoDJ analysis in VICE in DE can be found [here](https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45322621)

*NanoDJ has been tested using a clean Ubuntu virtual machine only with Docker v1.13.1 installed*

### **Run NanoDJ container:**

Clone the repository and pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) (recommended):

```
git clone https://github.com/genomicsITER/NanoDJ.git
cd NanoDJ
docker pull genomicsiter/nanodj:latest
```

*The NanoDJ image can be also built locally using *docker build -t genomicsiter/nanodj:latest .*

Create a container with the image:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /path/to/nanodjrepo/nanodj_notebooks:/home/jovyan/notebooks genomicsiter/nanodj:latest
```
In order to spawn the Bandage GUI from NanoDJ on your machine, you should run the container setting the [DISPLAY](https://askubuntu.com/questions/432255/what-is-the-display-environment-variable) environment variable and mounting the [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) socket as shown below. This is only valid for Linux users:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 \  
           -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \  
           -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \  
           -v /path/to/NanoDJ/nanodj_notebooks:/home/jovyan/notebooks \  
           genomicsiter/nanodj:latest
```

After running the *docker run* command, open  the localhost:8888/*token* link that appears in the output after the Jupyter Lab instance is started.

NanoDJ includes data and notebooks. However, a volume (the -v option) should be created to import these materials. With this volume, input and output data and modified notebooks can be saved on your host machine. 

**Mac users**

Notebooks directory must be added in the Docker GUI options (on file sharing section) before mounting that directory. Once it is in the list, volume should be mounted with the -v option as usual.

**Windows users**

Check that the directory that is going to be mounted is under the C:\Users directory. This path is written as "/c/Users/" in the -v option.

*On Windows 8.1, the Jupyter Lab instance cannot be accessed from localhost:8888/lab. "localhost" must be replaced with the IP of the VM that runs Docker on your system.*

**Write permission on notebook files**

Files and directories mounted as a volume doesn't have the [UID and GID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier) of the container's user (*jovyan*) so changes in notebooks can't be saved. You should change the owner of the mounted files with this command on your host machine after cloning the repository.

```
sudo chown -R 1000:100 ./nanodj_notebooks
```

With this command we change the owner recursively setting the UID and GID with the *jovyan* user values.
